# Microsoft Teams Backup
THis exports all Microsoft Teams calling settings and then can use the exported settings to restore them to a known good configuration. 
Currently this does the following:
  1. Exports all users and all users calling settings into two seperate csvs. 
  2. Imports user calling settings from the csv back into the Microsoft tenant.
